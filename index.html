    <p id="bio">
      Hello! Whether you stumbled upon my website by mere chance, or you found
      my work somewhere, feel free to look around. But first, let me tell you a
      bit about myself. I am currently a New Media Major and Graphic design
      Minor at Molloy College. I aim to one day find a career in the realm of
      graphic design and/or social media marketing. On this webpage you can see
      some of the work that I have created during my college career. This
      features many different Adobe Photoshop and Adobe Premiere Pro projects
      that I have created. They showcase the skills I have learned so far in
      regards to creating content for different social media platforms for
      different purposes. I hope you enjoy everything you see! If you want to
      get into contact with me, my contact info and social media pages are down
      below.
